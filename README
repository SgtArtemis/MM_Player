This is a simple music player that can play your local files.
It's design is heavily based on Spotify's design, and I think we've come fairly close.

Onyx Music Player was a project for the course INDA12 at KTH.
It is a collaboration between Mark Hobro and Marcus Heine

It should (hopefully) ask for the directory in which you keep your local .mp3 files the first time you open the program.
After the first time it will remember the directory.

Enjoy, and don't steal music :)
